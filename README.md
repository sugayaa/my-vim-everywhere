# my beloved vim
config heavily based on the primeagen's ["0 to lsp: neovim rc from scratch" video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7i4amO_zaE)
requires neovim 0.9 or higher.
this script is not optimized, there might be some redundancy.
lsp-zero seems to not be needed, as stated in [lsp-zero.nvim blog](https://lsp-zero.netlify.app/v3.x/blog/theprimeagens-config-from-2022.html)
